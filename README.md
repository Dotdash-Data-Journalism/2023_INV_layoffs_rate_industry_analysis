# Investopedia Layoffs Rate Information Sector Analysis

This repository contains the code and data behind the Investopedia article examining the layoffs and discharges rate in the U.S. workforce in the past year compared to the past twenty years, as well as a comparision by sector. The `data` folder contains supplementary data used in the analysis from the [University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Sentiment](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php) tracking how much positive and negative employment related news consumers have seen. The `visualizations` folder contains CSV files that created the four [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de) visualizations in the article. Analysis results can be reproduced using the code in the R file `layoffs_rate_industry_analysis.R` which will download data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' [Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/). Results may be slightly different in subsequent executions due to BLS data revisions.
